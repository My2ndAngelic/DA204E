# A self-made FAQ

## WPF
XAML is much more fun to write than WinForms in my opinion. It is scalable, web-friendly and a good introduction for HTML, which I may (or may not) learn in the future. However, the tag-based document is fun to write and fun to imagine without drag and drop designing tool.

Also I am using Rider, which does not have support designing WinForms for .NET Core, only .NET Framework. That is why my last 3 projects were in .NET Framework instead of .NET Core.

Maybe I would pick AvaloniaUI but that requires installing plugins for VS or Rider. Plus developing cross-platform application requires me to install Linux and macOS to test it, which I do not have time. .NET MAUI is out of the option since I am running on Windows 7.

## IDE
Rider. It is much easier to use than VS because I am familiar with IntelliJ IDEA.

## Windows 7
I forgot how many time I had to reinstall Windows 10 just to fix random bugs that appeared in my daily work. Sometimes I do not even know why those bugs exist and how to fix them. Windows 7 is stable for me so I have no plan to upgrade it. 

Maybe Windows 10 is better now but I am not sure, October 2018 is still there. Also Windows 10 sends too much data.

## Is WPF better than WinForms?
Probably. 

It is fun to write in WPF, especially the application scales pretty well. However, not all features of WinForms are available on WPF yet, especially FolderBrowserDialog, which is used in this project.

## Is coding in WPF is easier than WinForms?
Yes. For me it is just the matter of organize your elements into grids instead of pixel-based layouts.

## Final words
Thank you for reading and for the course.
