# A story about 

## Why WPF is chosen in the design of this instead of other framework?
XAML is much more fun to write than WinForms IMO. It is scalable, web-friendly and a good introduction for HTML, which I may (or may not) learn in the future. However, the tag-based document is fun to write and fun to imagine without drag and drop designing tool.

Also I am using Rider, which does not have support designing WinForms for .NET Core, only .NET Framework. That is why my last 3 projects were in .NET Framework instead of .NET Core.

## Is WPF better than WinForms?
